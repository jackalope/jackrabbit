# Jackrabbit patches for Jackalope

For making jackalope work, we need some patches for Jackrabbit. We maintain here a forked version of the trunk branch to not have to wait for jackrabbit to integrate them.

The branchname is 2.4-jackalope


# Patches not really needed for Jackalope to run (but nice to have for our setups)

## JCR-2968 : Add a JournalRead option for reading (but not writing) the Cluster Journal from a different place than the other journal data
