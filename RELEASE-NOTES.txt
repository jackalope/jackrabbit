Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 2.2.7

Introduction
------------

This is Apache Jackrabbit(TM) 2.2, a fully compliant implementation of the
Content Repository for Java(TM) Technology API, version 2.0 (JCR 2.0) as
specified in the Java Specification Request 283 (JSR 283).

Apache Jackrabbit 2.2.7 is patch release that contains fixes and
improvements over previous 2.2.x releases. This release is backwards
compatible with all earlier 2.x releases.

Note that earlier 2.2.x releases had a problem where very large positive
or negative long property values (more than 62 bits) could not be correctly
read from the reepository. The values are still correctly stored in the
reporistory, and can be properly read after upgrading to this release, but
any previous computations or other information derived from such properties
should be checked for correctness.
